I remember downloading the textures in the `Hill` directory from [HDRI Haven](https://hdri-haven.com/).
The site has apparently moved to [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/).
And it says their works are licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
Check their [Asset License](https://polyhaven.com/license) for further information.

Other textures (1.png, 2.png, etc.) are made by me (maeda6uiui) and licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
